# beaver-builder-fancy-heading
This is a simple custom Heading module for Beaver Builder. It creates new styling options so add "Side Lines" to your centered headings. This is a theme override, not a plugin. Copy the "heading" folder to "fl-builder/modules" inside your Wordpress theme folder. Feel free modify and ask for pull requests. I'm sure the code can be improved or expanded, I was working on a tight timeline when I created this ;)
